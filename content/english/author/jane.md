Hello, I’m Jane, the founder of Alpha Omega Digital.

I help businesses like yours build, modify and launch websites without stress.

I specialise in custom built sites on the Genesis Framework. I love complex challenges, and especially love rebuilding sites that are slow and not performing to sites that are fast, efficient and lead generating.

I provide a skills gap between business owners and your technical requirements, so your web services are outsourced to a highly skilled professional. A lot of the work I get is maintaining and updating wordpress websites. As a professional WordPress freelancer, I can provide you with an agency level service, for a fraction of the price.

My heart is to work with every type of business owner from SME’s to NPO’s, and provide a solution that works with your budget and goals. I am willing to take on messy jobs such as:  

***
- incomplete web projects
- conversions from bootstrap
- PSD to WordPress
- optimising images and tags for SEO.
- Gutenberg development
- CSS customisations
- PHP development

***
Please contact me with your web requirements, and let’s have a chat about what you’re looking for and how I can help you.
